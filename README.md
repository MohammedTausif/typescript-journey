# TypeScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my TypeScript learning journey! 🚀

In this repository, I will be documenting my daily progress as I learn and explore the various features of **TypeScript**. This includes coding challenges, important concepts, examples, and projects that I build along the way.

## 🧑‍💻 About This Repository

- **Purpose**: To document my learning process and showcase the skills I'm acquiring with TypeScript.
- **Content**: Each folder represents a day of learning. Inside, you’ll find explanations, code snippets, and mini-projects I worked on.
- **Goals**: By the end of this journey, I aim to become proficient in TypeScript and be able to apply it in building real-world applications.

## 🗓️ Learning Progress

### Day 1: Introduction to TypeScript
- Understanding the basics of TypeScript
- Setting up a TypeScript project
- Understanding Interface in TypeScript
  
### Day 2: Types, Arrays, and Enums in TypeScript
- Learned about type annotations and primitive types in TypeScript  
- Worked with arrays and union types  
- Explored enums to manage constants  


## 🚀 My Learning Goals

- **Master TypeScript**: From basic types to advanced features, including decorators, generics, and namespaces.
- **Build Projects**: Apply my knowledge to create small projects, and later scale to larger applications.
- **Understand Type Safety**: Embrace TypeScript's strong typing system and leverage it for safer and more maintainable code.
