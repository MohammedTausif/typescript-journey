# TypeScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my TypeScript learning journey! üöÄ

In this repository, I will be documenting my daily progress as I learn and explore the various features of **TypeScript**. This includes coding challenges, important concepts, examples, and projects that I build along the way.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About This Repository

- **Purpose**: To document my learning process and showcase the skills I'm acquiring with TypeScript.
- **Content**: Each folder represents a day of learning. Inside, you‚Äôll find explanations, code snippets, and mini-projects I worked on.
- **Goals**: By the end of this journey, I aim to become proficient in TypeScript and be able to apply it in building real-world applications.

## üóìÔ∏è Learning Progress

### Day 1: Introduction to TypeScript
- Understanding the basics of TypeScript
- Setting up a TypeScript project
- Understanding Interface in TypeScript
  
### Day 2: Types, Arrays, and Enums in TypeScript
- Learned about type annotations and primitive types in TypeScript  
- Worked with arrays and union types  
- Explored enums to manage constants

### Day 3: Revision Day  
- Reviewed previously learned topics, including:  
- Type annotations and primitive types  
- Arrays and union types  
- Enums for managing constants 
    
### Day 4: Generics and Modules in TypeScript
- Learned about generics for creating reusable and type-safe components  
- Explored how to use `export` and `import` to organize code across multiple files  
- Practiced creating and importing custom modules in TypeScript
  
### Day 5: Classes and Their Use Cases in TypeScript  
- Learned how to define and use classes in TypeScript  
- Explored constructors, methods, and properties  
- Understood access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`) and their use cases  
- Practiced inheritance and extending classes to build reusable components

### Day 6: Advanced Types in TypeScript  
- Learned about Type Guards for runtime type checking  
- Explored Utility Types like `Partial`, `Readonly`, and `Pick`  
- Worked with Intersection Types to combine multiple types  
- Understood Conditional Types for dynamic type definitions
  
### Day 7: Decorators and Namespaces in TypeScript  
- Learned about Class and Method Decorators for adding metadata and enhancing functionality  
- Practiced working with `Namespaces` to organize code  
- Reinforced understanding of `Import/Export` for module management in TypeScript  





## üöÄ My Learning Goals

- **Master TypeScript**: From basic types to advanced features, including decorators, generics, and namespaces.
- **Build Projects**: Apply my knowledge to create small projects, and later scale to larger applications.
- **Understand Type Safety**: Embrace TypeScript's strong typing system and leverage it for safer and more maintainable code.
